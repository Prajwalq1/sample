6.   2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10
     without any remainder.
     what is the smallest positive number that is 
     evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

:-  package com.hcl;

public class SmallestPositiveNumber {
	
		 
		static long gcd(long a, long b)
		{
		   if(a%b != 0)
		      return gcd(b,a%b);
		   else
		      return b;
		}
		 
		
		static long lcm(long n)
		{
		    long ans = 1;   
		    for (long i = 1; i <= n; i++)
		        ans = (ans * i)/(gcd(ans, i));
		    return ans;

}
		public static void main(String []args)
		{ //long n;
			//Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		//System.out.println("Enter the range of numbers from 1 to");
		//n=sc.nextlong();
		   long n = 20;
		    System.out.println("the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20 is "+lcm(n));
		 
		}
		}

output :-The smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20 is 232792560.
